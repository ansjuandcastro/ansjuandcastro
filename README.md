## 📌 Highlight Project: Project LOCH NESS – Radar Perception  
Developed a complete radar AI pipeline using synthetic Range-Doppler data:  
- Multi-class target detection (aircraft, ground vehicles, helicopters).  
- Self-supervised learning with contrastive pretraining (SimCLR).  
- Sliding-window classification with softmax heatmaps and bounding boxes.  
- Real-time inference on a 4-GPU PyTorch stack.  
- Deployment-ready on Jetson, FPGA, and mission platforms.  

**Benchmarks**  
- Models tested: ResNet18, AlexNet, EfficientNet, ResNet50  
- Best: ResNet18 → 99.2% accuracy (centered) / 96.2% F1 (cropped)
