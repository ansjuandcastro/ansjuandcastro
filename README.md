## 🔧 About Me

I’m a Lead Application Engineer at **Ansys**, working at the intersection of **RF/Microwave Engineering**, **Artificial Intelligence**, and **Cloud-Scale Simulation** to solve complex challenges in wireless design, radar perception, and digital engineering.

I support high-tech clients across North America—including aerospace, defense, automotive, and wireless—by integrating:

- 📡 **Electromagnetic simulation platforms** (HFSS, STK, RFCM, AEDT Icepak)  
- 🧠 **AI/ML workflows** (e.g., PyTorch, SimCLR, YOLO) for RF perception and radar intelligence  
- ☁️ **Scalable cloud/HPC pipelines** (AWS, Azure, Ansys Cloud) for high-fidelity, real-time EM simulation

My focus is on building intelligent radar systems, signal-aware design frameworks, and physics-informed AI models that accelerate innovation from digital prototype to edge deployment.

## 📌 Highlight Project: Radar Perception with Project LOCH NESS

Developed a full radar AI pipeline using synthetic Range-Doppler radar data from [Project LOCH NESS](https://www.ansys.com/campaigns/project-loch-ness), enabling:
- 🎯 Multi-class target detection (aircraft, ground vehicles, helicopters)
- 🔍 Self-supervised learning + contrastive pretraining (SimCLR)
- 🔗 Sliding-window classification → softmax heatmaps → bounding boxes
- ⚡ Real-time inference on 4-GPU PyTorch stack (v2.1)
- 📦 Modular deployment on Jetson, FPGA, and mission platforms

🧪 Models benchmarked: **ResNet18**, **AlexNet**, **EfficientNet**, **ResNet50**  
🏁 Best performer: **ResNet18** — 99.2% Acc (centered) / 96.2% F1 (cropped)
